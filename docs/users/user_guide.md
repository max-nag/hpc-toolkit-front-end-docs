# User Guide

This guide is for standard users of the Open Front End, who can access HPC
clusters and applications that have been setup by administrators. Users can
prepare, submit and run jobs on the cluster through the Front End.

## Access to the System

An administrator should have arranged access to the system for a standard user:

- A URL should be provided on which an instance of the HPC Toolkit Front End is
deployed.
- The Google identity of the user should be whitelisted to access the instance.
- The user should be set as an authorised users on existing HPC clusters.
- Admins can optionally set up quotas to restrict the amount of resources that
can be consumed by individual users.

Discuss requirements with the admin user in your organisation:

- Applications may require certain instance types to run efficiently on GCP.
Admins may be able to create new Slurm partitions to support new instance
types.
- Some applications may require additional configurations at install time e.g.
to switch on optional features. Admins can provide binaries for additional
application versions/variants.

On first visit, click the *Login* link on the home page, then click the
*Login with Google* link. The system will then attempt the authenticate your
account through OAuth with Google.

## Clusters

Shown on the cluster page is a list of active clusters the current user is
authorised to use. Clusters are created and managed by admin users so messages
on these pages are for information only. The underlying infrastructures, such
as network and storage components, are also managed by admin users so those
pages are not accessible by ordinary users.

## Applications

Shown on the application page is a list of pre-installed applications on
authorised clusters. Applications are set up by admin users so messages on
these pages are for information only. Application detail pages provide extra
information regarding the packages.

There are three types of applications:

- Those installed via the [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) package
  manager.
- Those installed from custom scripts as prepared by the admin users.
- Those manually installed on the clusters by admin users and then registered
  with this system.

Most open-source applications are covered by Spack. For in-house applications,
or those not yet supported by Spack, custom installation is often a good
option. Alternatively, admin users can manually install applications on a
shared filesystem and register them to the system by providing installation
paths and load commands (e.g. modulefiles). In practice, end users do not need
to distinguish these different types as they have access to a unified web
interface to automate job creation and submission.

## Jobs

From an application page, click the *New Job* action to set up a job.

In most cases, users do not need to be concerned about the application's
software environment because the system handles that automatically. For
example, if an application has been set up as a Spack package, the system will
automatically invoke `spack load` to configure its environment, e.g. putting
the application binaries in `$PATH`.

On the other hand, users need to provide the exact steps setting up jobs
through scripts. A run script can either be located at a URL or provided inline
in the job creation form. A run script may provide additional steps that
download and/or prepare input files before invoking the application binary. It
may also perform post-processing tasks as required.

### Using Cloud Storage

When submitting a new job, the end user may optionally specify:

- a URL from which input files are downloaded - `http://` or `https://` URL
  for an external storage, or a `gs://` URL a Google cloud storage bucket.
- a `gs://` URL to which output files are uploaded.

The system supports using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets as external
storage. Here the GCS bucket is a personal one belonging to the end user (for
admin users this is not to be confused with the GCS bucket that supports the
deployment of this system). A one-time set-up for the GCS bucket is required
per cluster: from the *Actions* menu of a cluster, click
*Authenticate to Google Cloud Storage* and then follow Google's instructions
to complete the authentication.

### Building Logic Directly in Run Script

Users can prepare the input data directly within the run script by using
arbitrary scripting. Simple tasks may be performed in this way, e.g.
downloading a public dataset from GitHub, or copying files already on the
shared filesystem to the working directory.

### Preparing Data Manually

It is also possible to prepare job data manually on the cluster. Users can
always SSH into cluster login node and run arbitrary commands to prepare data
in their home directories. Then job run scripts can access these files as
needed.

Manually preparing data is probably the most tedious. However, it can be most
cost-effective if a large amount of data is to be transmitted over the
internet, or the data is to be shared by multiple job runs. Moving large
datasets from inside the run script can add significant cloud spending as all
compute nodes reserved for jobs are being charged.

## Benchmarks

A benchmark is effectively a collection of jobs using the same application on
the same dataset. The application version and input dataset should always be
the same; the compiler/libraries to build the application and the cloud
instance types to run the application can differ, so that the most performant
or cost-efficient ways of running the jobs can be established through
benchmarks.

New benchmarks can be created by an admin user from the Benchmarks section of
the website.

For standard users, when running a job, there is an option to associated that
job to an existing benchmark, as shown in the following figure:

![Associate a job with a benchmark](../images/benchmark.png)

For benchmark jobs, the job script should contain logic to produce a key
performance indicator (KPI) which will be sent back to the service machine and
stored in the database. Job script should extract appropriate information from
the job output, and use suitable scripting to create a file called `kpi.json`
and place it in the current working directory.
This JSON file should be in the following format:

```json
{
  "result_unit": "some unit",
  "result_value": "some value"
}
```

## Vertex AI Workbenches

Vertex AI Workbenches give the user a dedicated interactive environment to
perform pre- or post-processing of data directly from the cluster, as
Jupyter Notebooks.

Please refer to the [Workbench User Guide](../users/workbench_user_guide).
